# NHSMM-MAR-sdNC
Code for state-dependent effective connectivity analysis using NHSMM-MAR-sdNC.

The example scripts provide some basic demonstration of the framework NSHMM-MAR-sdNC utilization.
Under Examples/, there are data and scripts used for the analysis conducted in the manuscript.

The complete code in Simulation1. and Simulation2. may be time-consuming, one may quickly get to know the NSHMM-MAR-sdNC utilization form "Basic demonstration about NSHMM-MAR-sdNC" and code in Simulation3.

Code about competitive model HMM-MAR is referred to
